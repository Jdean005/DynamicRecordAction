# DynamicRecordAction
The Dynamic Record Action LWC was inspired by a component that i've levered several times in the past called _The Record Detail Component._

##**Goals with this Component:**
1. Create a quick, admin confurable way to edit or view data on a lightning record page that is object agnostic. 
2. Give admins control of core functions not available with standard quick actions such as (form density, set fields quickly to read only or read write, set custom titles, control custom toast messaging service) 
3. Allow for Admins to enter a commma separated list of API names into a property and parse those values into an ordered list to be displayed on the quick action.
